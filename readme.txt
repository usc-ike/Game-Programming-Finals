As a final project for Game Programming Class I recreated the GBA Fire emblem game using the required framework.
Some of the challenges I faced was understanding the A* algorithm I used for the pathfinding as I was relatively new to the whole process of programming at this point in my life.
Some things to change if I were to code this now would be to:
1) distribute the functions across multiple files for readability (most of my code is written in game.java)
2) utilization of data files instead of hard coding data into another java file
